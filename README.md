# Build-Multimodal-Rag-Colpali-PDF-and-Ollama-Gemma3-Vision-Models

## Description

This project demonstrates how to build a powerful Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of understanding both text and images within PDF documents. It leverages the Colpali library to extract images from PDF files and utilizes an Ollama-hosted Gemma3 vision model (specifically the 4 billion parameter version or larger) to provide insightful answers to your queries based on the combined content of the PDF. This system allows you to ask questions that require understanding not just the text but also the visual information present in your PDF documents.

## Key Features

* **Multimodal Understanding:** Processes and understands both textual and visual information from PDF documents.
* **PDF Image Extraction:** Uses the Colpali library to automatically extract images embedded within PDF files.
* **Ollama Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Ollama to run the Gemma3 vision model locally.
* **Gemma3 Vision Inference:** Employs the state-of-the-art Gemma3 model (4b or larger) for reasoning about the combined text and image content.
* **RAG Architecture:** Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline to provide contextually relevant answers.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1.  **Install Ollama:**
    Ollama is required to run the Gemma3 model locally. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system on the official Ollama website: [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

2.  **Pull the Gemma3 Model:**
    Once Ollama is installed and running, pull the Gemma3 model that supports multimodal functionalities. **Important:** Ensure you pull a version that is 4 billion parameters or larger (e.g., `gemma3:4b` or a larger variant). Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    ollama pull gemma3:4b
    ```
    You can replace `gemma3:4b` with a larger version if available and desired.

3.  **Install Python and Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You will need to install the Colpali library and potentially other Python packages. It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

    # Install Colpali and other necessary libraries (you might need to install other libraries depending on your RAG implementation)
    pip install colpali
    pip install ipython  # For displaying images in some environments
    pip install ollama
    # Add any other libraries your specific implementation requires (e.g., for document loading, indexing, etc.)
    ```

## Usage

Here's how to use the project to ingest a PDF and query it:

1.  **Prepare Your PDF Document:**
    Place the PDF document you want to analyze in a designated directory within your project (e.g., a folder named `documents`).

2.  **Implement the RAG Pipeline:**
    You will need to write Python code to implement the RAG pipeline. This typically involves the following steps:
    * **Loading the PDF:** Load your PDF document.
    * **Image Extraction (using Colpali):** Use Colpali to extract images from the PDF. You might need to iterate through the pages of the PDF and extract images as needed.
    * **Text Extraction:** Extract the text content from the PDF.
    * **Indexing (Optional but Recommended):** You might want to index the text and potentially the image features to enable efficient retrieval. This could involve using libraries like Langchain, LlamaIndex, or creating your own indexing mechanism.
    * **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question, retrieve relevant text snippets and potentially associated images based on the query.
    * **Generation (using Ollama Gemma3):** Send the user's question along with the retrieved context (text and image data) to the Ollama Gemma3 model for generating an answer.

3.  **Example Code Snippet (Illustrative - Adapt to your specific implementation):**

    ```python
    from IPython.display import Image, display
    import base64
    import ollama
    import colpali

    def load_and_extract_images(pdf_path):
        """Loads a PDF and extracts images using Colpali."""
        images = colpali.extract_images(pdf_path)
        return images

    def display_image_from_base64(image_base64):
        """Displays an image from a base64 string."""
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(image_base64)
        filename = 'temp_image.jpg'
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(image_bytes)
        display(Image(filename))

    def query_gemma3_vision(question: str, image_base64: str = None):
        """Sends a question and an optional image to the Gemma3 vision model."""
        messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': question}]
        if image_base64:
            messages[0]['images'] = [image_base64]

        response = ollama.chat(
            model='gemma3:4b',
            messages=messages
        )
        return response['message']['content']

    # Example Usage
    pdf_file = "path/to/your/document.pdf"  # Replace with the actual path
    extracted_images = load_and_extract_images(pdf_file)

    # You would typically implement a more sophisticated RAG pipeline here
    # For this simple example, let's assume you want to ask a question about the first image found
    if extracted_images:
        first_image = extracted_images[0]
        user_question = "Describe this image."
        answer = query_gemma3_vision(user_question, first_image['base64'])
        print(f"Question: {user_question}")
        print(f"Answer from Gemma3: {answer}")
        display_image_from_base64(first_image['base64'])

    # You can also ask questions that might relate to both text and images,
    # depending on how you've structured your RAG pipeline.
    # For instance, if you've indexed text and associated images:
    # user_question_complex = "Explain figure 1 and its significance based on the text."
    # # Your RAG pipeline would retrieve the relevant text and image (if figure 1 was identified)
    # # and then you would send both to Gemma3.
    ```

4.  **Run Your Code:**
    Execute your Python script that implements the RAG pipeline.

5.  **Ask Questions:**
    Interact with your system by providing questions related to the content of your PDF document. The Gemma3 model, with the help of the retrieved context (including images), should provide relevant answers.
